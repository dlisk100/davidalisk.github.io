    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Background</strong><br/>
      I am a second-year MBA student at NYU Stern and a mechanical engineer by training (University of Illinois).
    </p>
    <p>
      My career began in the physical world—engineering complex systems and managing projects in the energy and life sciences sectors. I spent four years solving problems where failure wasn't an option, from oilfield services to biotech manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Focus</strong><br/>
      I transitioned to business school to bridge the gap between technical execution and corporate strategy. My interests lie in <strong>American Dynamism</strong> and <strong>Hard Tech</strong>, specifically how we can apply modern software stacks to revitalize physical infrastructure, manufacturing, and logistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I believe in the primacy of atoms, I am deeply interested in the digital leverage that AI and software provide to physical industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Current Work</strong><br/>
      Currently, I am exploring AI demand elasticities through the Glucksman Fellowship and writing about the mechanics of product growth.
